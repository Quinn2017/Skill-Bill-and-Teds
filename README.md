# Skill-Bill-and-Teds
A nostalgic return to an 80s classic 'Bill and Ted'. (Mycroft Skill)

## Synopsis:
The skill lets you invoke the  air guitar soundclip.

## CURRENT STATE:
Works, I think, but still in initial testing phase.

## REQUIREMENTS
No requirements. 

## USAGE:
Say "station" or "wild stallions" to invoke air guitar. 

## ISSUES / TODO:
No known problems. Need to add longer air guitar mp3.
