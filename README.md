# Skill-Bill-and-Teds
A nostalgic return to an 80s classic 'Bill and Ted'. A Mycroft skill that lets you invoke air guitar soundclip in style. 

## CURRENT STATE:
Initial phases. 

## REQUIREMENTS
No requirements. 

## USAGE:
Say the iconic phrase "station" or "wild stallions" to invoke air guitar.

## ISSUES / TODO:
- Understand why the .dialog and self.process.wait() can't be inserted.
- Add longer / different air guitar clips.
