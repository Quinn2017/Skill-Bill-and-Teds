# Skill-Bill-and-Teds
A nostalgic return to an 80s classic 'Bill and Ted'. A Mycroft skill that lets you invoke air guitar soundclip.

## CURRENT STATE:
The skill Works.

## REQUIREMENTS
No requirements. 

## USAGE:
Say "station" or "wild stallions" to invoke air guitar.

## ISSUES / TODO:
No known problems. 
I just need to add longer / different air guitar clips.
